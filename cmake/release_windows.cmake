# The player release for Windows (route B, 32-bit, cross-built with MinGW-w64 by the

#   dxvk/d3d9.dll             DXVK (Direct3D 9 on Vulkan); the game falls back to the
#                             system's d3d9.dll without it or without Vulkan
#   assets/README.md          the player copies the game dump here
#   LICENSES/                 the port's notes plus every bundled component's license
#
# The GCC runtime and SDL3 are linked in; OpenAL Soft stays a DLL (LGPL: replaceable).
# DXVK is the official prebuilt 32-bit d3d9.dll staged by
# packaging/dxvk/fetch-prebuilt.sh: no source build, no podman/meson/glslang.
