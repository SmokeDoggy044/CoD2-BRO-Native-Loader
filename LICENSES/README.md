# Licenses

This folder holds the license texts of everything in the repository and in the
releases.

## The port's own code

Everything outside `third_party/` is original work of this project:

    Copyright (C) 2026 the CoD2-BRO-Native-Loader contributors

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
    the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
    Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
    version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
    WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

The license text is `LICENSE` at the repository root (also
`GPL-2.0-or-later.txt` here).

None of the headers below are compiled into any build; the port has its own
(`audio/xbox_dsound.h`, `online/xonline.h`, `render/xbox_d3d.h`, ...). Only
`xboxkrnl.h` (CC0) is read, by `tools/gen_kernel_exports.py`, to generate
`xbox/kernel_exports.inc`. GPL-2.0-or-later code from them (or from Cxbx-Reloaded
or xemu) could be used directly, since the port has the same license.

## Third-party code

`third_party/xbox-includes/` (a git submodule of github.com/mborgerson/xbox-includes,
pinned at commit 0f8e252 of 2024-07-30; its own `COPYING` is the GPL-2.0 text; its
`Makefile` and `xbox.cpp` are not built):

| Files | License | Text |
|---|---|---|
| `d3d8.h`, `d3d8types.h`, `dsound.h`, `dsoundtypes.h`, `xacteng.h`, `xapi.h`, `xgraphic.h`, `xonline.h` (from Cxbx) | GPL-2.0-or-later | `GPL-2.0-or-later.txt` |
| `xboxkrnl.h` | CC0-1.0 | `CC0-1.0.txt` |
| `d3d8types_wine.h` (from Wine) | LGPL-2.1-or-later | `LGPL-2.1-or-later.txt` |
| `xboxdef.h` | no notice in the file; the package's `COPYING` (GPL-2.0) | `GPL-2.0-or-later.txt` |

`game/code/zlib.cpp` and `game/code/unzip.cpp`: decompiled from the title's linked copies of
zlib 1.1.4 (Copyright (C) 1995-2002 Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler, zlib license) and unzip 0.15
(Copyright (C) 1998 Gilles Vollant, the zlib license), using the upstream sources as a guide; each
file keeps its upstream notice. The zlib license allows use in GPL software.

`fonts/`: unmodified fonts under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 (EB Garamond, Jost,
Liberation Serif, Anton); sources and license texts in `fonts/README.md` and
`fonts/licenses/`. They are shipped as separate files next to the programs, which
the OFL allows alongside software under any license.

Fetched by CMake at configure time, not stored here: Dear ImGui (MIT,
github.com/ocornut/imgui, tag v1.91.9) for the launcher; stb_truetype (MIT or
public domain, github.com/nothings/stb) for sharper text; on Windows also SDL3
(zlib) and OpenAL Soft (LGPL-2.0-or-later). Releases include their license texts
and those of every other bundled library (`LICENSES/BUNDLED.txt` in an archive).

## Bundled in this fork

| Files | License | Text |
|---|---|---|
| `modding/stb/stb_image.h`, `stb_image_write.h` (nothings/stb, commit `2c980bb`) | MIT or public domain | `modding/stb/LICENSE` |
| official DXVK 2.7.1 32-bit binaries fetched by `packaging/dxvk/fetch-prebuilt.sh` and bundled in releases (including libdisplay-info) | zlib / MIT | `dxvk/prebuilt/LICENSES/DXVK.txt`, `dxvk/prebuilt/LICENSES/libdisplay-info.txt` |
| SDL3 3.2.10 (system library on Linux, built in on Windows) | zlib | `LICENSES/SDL3-zlib.txt` |
| OpenAL Soft (shared library, replaceable) | LGPL-2.1-or-later | `LICENSES/OpenAL-Soft-LGPL.txt` (also `LGPL-2.1-or-later.txt`) |

The application icon in `packaging/icons/` is derived from the game's cover art
supplied for this fork. It is used only to identify the executables/windows;
all rights to the artwork and trademarks remain with their owners. It is not
game data and is not loaded by the game itself.

The Discord RPC code in `discord/` is entirely original and part of the port's
own GPL-2.0-or-later code; it implements Discord's local IPC protocol without
linking or bundling any Discord library. The `modding/` sources are likewise
original; only the stb headers above are third-party.

## Not in this repository

Call of Duty 2: Big Red One and its files (XBE, assets) belong to their owners and
are never committed: the port loads them from the user's own copy of the game.
`tools/data/default_xbe_symbols.txt` lists function addresses and analysis names
from a Ghidra export, with no game code or data.
