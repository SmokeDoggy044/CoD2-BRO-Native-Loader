/* cod_bro_loader.exe on Windows: a tiny executable at the XBE's base address, so the
   title's image range belongs to us before anything else is mapped. Its zero-filled
   array makes the image cover the whole range (win32_layout.h). It also reserves the
   kernel's fixed memory ranges, then loads the loader proper from
   cod_bro_loader_core.dll, which maps the XBE over this image and never returns.

   Built without the C runtime and importing only kernel32 (already loaded with
   ntdll), as the process's first code after Windows' own. */
